# PortfolioTemplate
A portfolio website template written by me in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with utilizing AJAX

All the hard front-end coding is done for you! All you have to do is implement your own content for each page!

Each pages content is load in via Javascript AJAX; therefore, the web page will never reload to switch to different parts of the portfolio! However, each page has a hard-coded html file in case someone wants to send a specific page of the template to someone else. Each .html file outside the content_components folder has the same code; the only differences is the routing to each content  and the URL building in Javascript when a user switches pages.

Usage:

The folder content_components houses html files that are written by you for the content of each individual page: Home, Skills, Projects, & Contact. Implement your own content into these files. You should not have to modify the hard pages (such as index.html and any html files outside content_components).

You can modify the styling of the template by modifying index.css, as it houses all the styling for the entire template.
