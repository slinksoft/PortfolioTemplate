<h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

Custom html/css can be put in these components that you see.

This one is homepage.html.
<br>
<font color=#FF0000>NOTE: the page size adjusts automatically, no matter how much content you decide to put.</font>

<br>
<br>

<b><u>All the hard front-end coding is done for you! All you have to do is go into the content_components directory and start implementing your own content!!!</u></b>

<br><br>
If you wish to change some styling such as the title color or link animations, check out the index.css file; it houses the entire template's styling.

<br><br>

<b><font color=#00BB00>NOTE: The title for the portfolio is under my name because I intend on making a brief portfolio on my Github pages with this portfolio template I wrote. Stay tuned for that!</font></b>
